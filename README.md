## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to summarize ride-sharing data in order to better visualize ride fares by city type.

## Results
Ride fare trends among all three city types were generally the same from the start of the year through the middle of February. All three city types also experienced a short uptick in ride fares towards the end of February, followed by a noticeable downturn. Urban ride fares were rather erratic in the month of March, while rides in suburban and rural areas stayed relatively stable. Overall, ride fares in urban areas far outnumbered ride fares in suburban areas. Ride fares in rural areas fared even lower.

## Summary
Ride fares are generally high in urban areas, likely due to the lack of space for urban residents to drive and park their own cars. To encourage higher ridership in rural areas, the PyBer CEO should implement discounts and specials in rural areas during peak hours. In addition, the CEO should consider diversifying into meal deliveries, which may increase ride fares in suburban areas, since suburban residents may be more likely to drive a car to pick up a meal. Finally, the CEO should consider implementing discounts towards the end of February, when ride fares dip noticeably among all city types.
